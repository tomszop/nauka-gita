        <h1>Rockin' in the Free World</h1>
        <h2>Neil Young</h2>
        
        <p>There's colors on the street<br>
            Red, white and blue<br>
            People shufflin' their feet<br>
            People sleepin' in their shoes<br>
            But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead<br>
            There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead<br>
            Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them<br>
            So I try to forget it any way I can<br><br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br><br>
            I see a woman in the night<br>
            With a baby in her hand<br>
            There's an old street light (near a garbage can)<br>
            Near a garbage can (near a garbage can)<br>
            And now she put the kid away and she's gone to get a hit<br>
            She hates her life and what she's done to it<br>
            There's one more kid that'll never go to school<br>
            Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool<br><br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br><br>
            We got a thousand points of light<br>
            For the homeless man<br>
            We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand<br>
            We got department stores and toilet paper<br>
            Got Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer<br>
            Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive<br>
            Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive<br><br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world<br>
            Keep on rockin' in the free world</p>
